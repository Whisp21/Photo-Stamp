## What this app does (#overview):

Photo Stamp is a web app that stores your favourite photos online so you will never lose them! Each photo is saved as a Stamp. Once saved, the Stamps display in a polaroid style in your home page. Each Stamp takes the date when the photo was taken as well as a caption.

## Technologies used (#technologies):

### - Reactâš¡

I decided to use React because I thought this project would be a good way to practice using components, passing data through those components and implementing routing with a front end library. 

### - FirebaseðŸ”¥

Firebase made it really simple to implement user login and setting up a database. I really enjoyed using Firebase and will definitely use it again.

### - SASSðŸŽ¨

When using multiple stylesheets, I like to use SASS. I find that creating and using variables, nested syntax and using mixins are great features to have when managing the styling of a project with multiple components.

## Challenges I faced (#challenges): 

Implementing the user login and private routing was a daunting task - it is a feature that nearly all web and mobile apps have but it is a feature that can be difficult to set up and easy to mess up. But the challenge was worth the outcome! Firebase made it very easy to get user login setup. The private routing (fetching and displaying the Stamps specific to the current user logged in) required some more research but at the end of the day, it works great! If I ever need to implement these features again, I will be using the project as a reference.

# Getting Started with Create React App (#usage)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
